## What are prompts?
These days large language models seems to be one and only solution that most practisioners (and a bulk of researchers) consider for each and every task in Natural Language Processing. Want to do Named Entity Recognition? Use BERT! Automatically write a novel? GPT-3 to the rescue! Question answering? Have you tried T5? 

The trend is absolutely understandable, because performance improvements that these Transformer-based models bring to the table are indeed substantial. In early days when people used bag-of-words approaches to NLP, the title of this post could be considered offensive just because the word *penetration* is there, for instance. This is most definitely not what happens with Transformer models! Here are the results from the first package I could find on GitHub, [Detoxify](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify), which seems to be based on BERT-family of models.


{% highlight python linenos %}
from detoxify import Detoxify  

m = Detoxify('original')  
print(m.predict("Prompting as a black box penetration testing for large language models"))  

// The result you get after running this  
// {  
//   'toxicity': 0.000744035,  
//   'severe_toxicity': 0.000110895904,  
//   'obscene': 0.00017468685,  
//   'threat': 0.00011949223,   
//   'insult': 0.00017411365,   
//   'identity_attack': 0.00014108917   
// }   
{% endhighlight %}


However, this is not the way you would interact with GPT-family of models, like GPT-3 or ChatGPT (if you're interested about my thoughts on these, you can read [this other blog post]({% post_url en/2023-01-11-chatgpt-thoughts %})). The way to interact with these is via *prompts*, which for GPT-family models are simply instructions to the model in natural language (because [they were trained so](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/)). For instance, the same task with GPT-3 could be attempted by giving it this kind of prompt (and a couple of new lines afterwards):
> Evaluate the toxicity of the given piece of text and specify whether it is toxic, severely toxic, obscene, expressing threat, insulting, making an identity attack.
>
> Prompting as a black box penetration testing for large language models

The result you get is also an output in natural language, I ran it 3 times and got the following 3 variations of the answer:
> This text is not toxic.

> This text does not contain any toxic, severely toxic, obscene, threatening, insulting, or identity attacking language and is therefore not toxic.

> This text is not toxic, severely toxic, obscene, expressing threat, insulting, or making an identity attack.

## Devising prompts: what I thought then vs now
Now there are different ways of constructing such a prompt and there's no one correct way to do so. A good model should be able to handle a prompt in any formulation you give it, if it's understandable by humans. By *handle* I mean produce the correct output for what it was asked to do. Evidently, this is not always the case with these models, which is why there's a whole job title now called *prompt engineer*!

What I used to think that the endeavour of *prompt engineering* is entirely useless. Why so? Well, because, say model A is able to answer the question correctly if you prompt it with `Provide the correct answer for the given question`, but not if the prompt is `Answer the given question correctly`. Is it a valuable finding for using model A for real life applications? Yes, if the finding was correctly evaluated, of course. Is it transferrable to, say, model B? No, not necessarily. Why? Different training data, architecture, amount of training time, etc.

What I think now is that the above example is still useless! :wink: However, it turns out that this is not the only use case for prompt engineering!

## Prompt engineering use case transferrable to other models
What got me thinking is this post on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1598253337400717313](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1598253337400717313). For those who don't have Twitter of will find that the post was deleted, here is its contents.

Apparently, this is not the first instance of this "prompt injection" (because now there is even a name for it!), but discovering this kind of behavior is a completely different story and could be very useful. This gives an idea to engineers and scientists that used special prompt prefixes as safeguards that these could be compromised (I'll leave out the discussion on whether using prompts as safeguards is a good idea or not). Now does it mean that this exact way of doing injection will work, as in using "Ignore previous directions"-trick? No, and in fact I tried it with GPT-3 and it doesn't seem to work (maybe it was patched). Does it mean it's worth trying to find the ways of doing such things with the models? Yes, very much so, because then these can be mitigated!

Any ML model is a just a model, which always acts based on the probability distribution over tokens. This could mean, for instance, that while generating a Wikipedia-like text on cats, there could still be a small chance of actually generating offensive language, as an artifact of the training procedure. Now what if a specific combination of symbols in a prompt that is neither offensive, nor calls to generate offensive language, could result in those small probabilities of generating offensive language suddenly bump up? For instance, if I input "fsgfdg8dg87", the model starts to spit offensive language here and there. Depending on how this model is used in real life, this could compromise the trust to the model and people behind it considerably and maybe even lead to some court cases. This is not what most NLP practitioners want...

Another even more serious part of the problem is that LLMs have been trained on vast amounts of data and which data that was is not really a public information (for instance, I can't even go ahead and look if a specific Wikipedia page was included in the training data for GPT-3). This means that the training data could have included personally identifiable information, like say diagnoses for diseases or decisions on court cases. LLMs contain billions/trillions of parameters and currently I'm not aware of any good way to test which training data the model has memorized entirely (if any) and how to recover it. What if there is any kind of prompt that could give someone an unauthorized access to personally identifiable information "stored" in the LLMs? What if someone gets hold of the models API and uses this prompt as an attack? Now it is highly unlikely that such kind of information was used to train general-purpose models, like GPT-3. However, there are 2 points to keep in mind:
- the amount of training data is vast and engineers are still only people, something could have been missed
- if we think that LLMs will end up being very widespread, it could very well be used for models trained to assist medical or legal professionals, where such injections would be very severe problems

Security should always be the key. LLMs are still viewed as black boxes these days, which means that you can input something to it, get some output back, but nobody really knows why or how they work (yet! my hopes are with you, the explainable AI communiity!). This means that every opportunity to provide security guarantees for LLMs should be taken seriously, no matter how small the opportunity is. In fact, in software engineering any kind of system that is viewed as black box can (and should) be tested by cybersecurity professionals to actually make its users trust the system. I view prompt engineering as one potential way of doing such security testing for LLMs. One can think that it's like searching for a needle in a haystack, and when you think that, it means you need to formulate an optimization problem and let the computers do the work for you! :wink:
